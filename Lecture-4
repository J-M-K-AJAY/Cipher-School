                                                Lecture-4 Features Of Java.
Features Of Java - Simple
                 - Object Oriented
                 - Platform Independent
                 - Architectue Neutral
                 - Portable
                 - Robust
                 - Secure
                 - High Performance
                 - Multi Threaded
                 - Distributed
1) Simple - Easy syntax.
          - Syntax based on C++.
          - No complicated features like pointers, operator overloading etc,.
          - Automatic Garbage Collection to remove unreferenced objects and thus programmers are free from memory management responsibilities.
2) Object Oriented - Java is Object Oriented programming Language.
                   - Just like the real world, it is centered on creating objects, manuplating objects and making them work together.
                   - OOPs is better than procedural programming because it provides great flexibility, modularity, clarity and reusability.
                   - OOPs is more secure as it provides data hiding features.
3) Platform Independent - "Write once run anywhere" feature of java makes it platorm independent. It allows a Java Program to run on any operating system like Windows, Linux, Mac or Solaris.
                        - Other languages like C, C++, etc,. are directly complied into platform specific machine codes.
                        - An additional layer (class file) is added in java to achieve platform independence.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is responsible to convert the byte code into the machine code.
JVM itself is platform dependent. There is a seperate JVM available for each opearating system.
Different JVM produces different binary code for different operating systems.
Using byte code and differnent JVMs for different operating systems Java achieves its platform independence and makes software development easy to run on different platforms.

4) Architecture Neutral - Java has an essential feature that allows the applications to run easily on different machines with different hardware architecture.
                        - There are no architecture dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.
                        - In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for64-bit architecture.
                        - In java it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures.
5) Portable - The platform independence and Architecture Neutral features of java makes it portable.
            - Portable because it facilitates to carry the java bytecode to any platform.
6) Robust - Means strong/ reliable
          - Java has eliminated certain types of errors prone programming constructs that are found in other languages.
          - Using exception handling mechanism, Java can catch and respond to expectional situations, so that a program can continue its normal execution.
          - Java has a strong memory allocation and garbage collection mechanism.
          - It does not support pointers, thereby eliminating the possiblities of overwriting memory and corrupting data.
7) Secure - It is more secure.
          - Java does not use pointers explicitly.
          - Java program runs under  an area known as Sand Box.
          - Security manager determines the accessiblity options of a class, like reading and writing a file to the local disk.
          - Java uses a public key encryption system to allows the java application transmit over the internet in the secured encrypted form.
8) High Perfomance - Faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because java bytecode is "close" to native code.
                   - But it is not as fast as compiled languages, such as C++, Because java is intrepreted.
                   - The new JVM is significantly faster than the earlier one. The new JVM uses the technology known as Just-in-Time compilation(JIT).It converts the byte code into machine code on demand basis.
9) Multi Threaded - Multithreading means a single program having different independent tasks to be performed independently at the same time.
                  - We can write java programs that deal with many tasks at one by defining multiple threads.
                  - Multithreading is particularly useful in server applications, a server can serve multipe clients at the same time.
                  - In java, threads can be created in two ways: by extending Thread class and by implementing Runnable interface.
10) Distributed - Several computers work together on a network.
                - It is designed to develop applications that make distributed computing easy and efficient.
                - This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.
