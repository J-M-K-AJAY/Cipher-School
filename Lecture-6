                                    Lecture-5 Instantiation.
Conditional Statement: if-else, Only if, nested
                     : Switch
Loops (Iteration/Repetition Statements) : for loop
                                        : while
                                        : do-while
Instantiation Process : Creating a variable to store the reference of the object.
                      : Create an object using 'new' keyword.
                      : Assigning reference of the created object to the variable.
Heap & Stack Memory.
Two types of memory in Java: Stack and Heap.
Heap : Shared memory.(Primitive Data types and Local variables).
Stack : every method has its own stack.(Method area).
                      eg: class Student
                          {
                              String name;
                              int rollno;
                          }
Here,
The variable goes to the Stack and the object goes to the Heap memory.
